# Source Registry

This registry lists all data sources used in the construction of *Future History* volumes.

Each entry includes:

- **Source** — Name of the dataset, platform, or archive.
- **Domain** — The field or theme it contributes to (e.g. energy, ecology, geopolitics).
- **License** — Legal terms of use; all sources must be openly licensed or used with permission.
- **Snapshot** — The date the data was retrieved and frozen for the annual cycle.
- **Class** — Whether the source is *Factual*, *Human-produced* (e.g. forecasts), or *Speculative*.
- **Continuation Rule** — The method by which the source is extended into the future (e.g. projection model, scenario blend, flatline + drift).

All data are archived with full provenance. Sources are never edited after the snapshot. If upstream errors are discovered, they are handled in the following year’s cycle — never retroactively.

This page is the backbone of the <span class="notranslate"> FUTURE ENGINE </span>'s transparency.
