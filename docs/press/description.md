## Full version

The Future_Engine_Project is a long-term civic forecasting initiative. Each year, it produces a single, coherent timeline spanning the next thousand years — a *Future History* — blending data-driven modeling with public narrative. The goal is not to predict, but to reflect: to offer a continuous, plausible history of the future that invites critique, insight, and participation. Every part of the process is documented and open: from source data and modeling techniques to the narrative structure itself. The project is governed independently, guided by a fixed design codex, and committed to building legitimacy through transparency, continuity, and civic trust.
