# How to Propose Changes

The Future Engine is open to careful contributions. If you have data, insights, or concerns to share, here’s how to begin.

### 1. Start a conversation
Open a [discussion](https://github.com/AurochForge/future-engine-project/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/AurochForge/future-engine-project/issues). Be clear about what you’re proposing and why it matters.

### 2. Share your sources
Provide links to any relevant data or documents. Include:
- License and retrieval date
- Known limitations or uncertainties
- Any prior use in forecasting contexts

### 3. Let the process unfold
If your proposal fits the scope and integrity of the project:
- A decision record (ADR) will be drafted
- The [source registry](../provenance/registry.md) will be updated
- You’ll be credited appropriately

### 4. Pitch an essay
If you want to write a reflective essay for the *Future History*, send a 200–400 word abstract and a short bio. See the [Essay Invitations](essays.md) page for tone and context.
