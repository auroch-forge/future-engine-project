# Future Engine Codex  
## Part III — Role of AI  

*Artificial Intelligence is not the star of the Future Engine. It is a servant of method, a craftsman at the edges, and a voice at the end.*

### Principles  

* **Transparency** — Every use of AI is disclosed and documented. Nothing is hidden.  
* **Subordination** — AI does not define the methodology. It operates within boundaries set by statistical and futurological design.  
* **Utility** — AI is used where it is uniquely suited: ingesting unstructured inputs, weaving cross-scale coherence, generating narrative prose.  
* **Non-Centrality** — The credibility of the Future Engine rests on data, models, and ritual. AI is present but never sovereign.

### Roles of AI in the Engine  

**Input Parsing**  
* Natural language material — scientific literature, news, foresight reports — is structured through LLM-assisted extraction.  
* Provenance and citations are preserved; AI is a tool of formatting, not judgment.  

**Weaving & Constraint Checking**  
* The scale of the Engine requires massive cross-lane consistency checks.  
* AI assists in mapping dependencies, flagging contradictions, and ensuring plausibility across domains.  
* It acts as an invisible craftsman: binding arcs together, not inventing them.  

**Black Swan Generation**  
* Black swans, by definition, resist quantification.  
* LLMs are uniquely suited to propose improbable but describable events.  
* These proposals are filtered through plausibility gates and historical analogies before entering the timeline.  

**Narrative Output**  
* The public artifact — the Future History — is written in prose.  
* AI provides the narrative voice, rendering the statistical backbone into civic storytelling.  
* This is the most visible use of AI, but also the most bounded: style, not substance.

### Public Perception  

* To the lay audience, “AI-made” may be a stigma. To the informed audience, the methodology speaks louder.  
* By documenting AI’s role clearly, the project avoids both exaggeration and concealment.  
* Experts can judge the soundness of the approach; the public can trust in the openness of the process.

### Vow  

The Future Engine does not pretend to be free of AI. It uses AI where necessary, discloses it always, and refuses to let it become the star.  

*The authority of the Future History rests on data, method, and continuity. AI is the pen, not the hand.*
