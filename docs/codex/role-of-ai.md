# FUTURE_ENGINE Design Codex

## Part III — Role of AI

*Artificial Intelligence plays a defined and transparent role within FUTURE_ENGINE. It operates under methodological boundaries, contributing where it is structurally suited, but never determining the direction of the system.*

---

### Principles

* **Transparency** — All uses of AI are disclosed and documented. Nothing is hidden.
* **Subordination** — AI does not define the methodology. It functions strictly within the framework set by statistical design and futurological intent.
* **Utility** — AI is deployed where it has unique technical advantage: parsing unstructured inputs, supporting internal consistency, and producing narrative output.
* **Non-Centrality** — FUTURE_ENGINE derives its authority from data, models, and ritual structure. AI assists, but does not lead.

### Roles of AI in the Engine

**Input Parsing**

* Scientific literature, journalism, and foresight documents are structured through LLM-assisted extraction.
* Provenance and citation are preserved; AI formats the material without asserting judgment.

**Weaving & Constraint Checking**

* Given FUTURE_ENGINE’s scope, internal coherence across domains is essential.
* AI helps map interdependencies, identify contradictions, and maintain cross-scale plausibility.
* It supports the integration of outputs without altering the foundational logic.

**Black Swan Generation**

* Low-probability, high-impact events are difficult to model through standard techniques.
* LLMs can propose hypothetical but structured scenarios.
* These are subjected to plausibility filters and benchmarked against historical precedent before inclusion.

**Narrative Output**

* The Future History is composed in natural language.
* AI renders statistical and causal structure into a civic narrative style.
* This function is bounded: AI provides form, not substance.

### Public Perception

* Some audiences may carry concern or skepticism regarding AI involvement.
* By documenting the role of AI in detail, the project ensures clarity over spectacle.
* The system's credibility rests not on novelty, but on methodological integrity and full disclosure.

### Structural Vow

FUTURE_ENGINE uses artificial intelligence where appropriate, documents its use rigorously, and maintains human oversight at all levels. AI is a tool in service of method — never its source, never its sovereign.

*The Future History is shaped by evidence and design. AI contributes to its telling, not to its truth.*
