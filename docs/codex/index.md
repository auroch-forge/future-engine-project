# FUTURE_ENGINE Design Codex

## Master Index

*The Codex is the living record of the evolution of FUTURE_ENGINE. It is divided into five parts, each self-contained, but together they form the complete design.*

---

### Part I — Core Architecture

The technical backbone: principles, inputs, data structures, modeling framework, annual cycle, horizons, and limits.
\[See document: **Core Architecture**]

### Part II — Narrative & Public Philosophy

The civic rationale: why the output is a story, the elder’s voice, one timeline, reflective essays, and narrative style.
\[See document: **Narrative Public Philosophy**]

---

### Part III — Role of AI

The boundaries of artificial intelligence in the Engine: input parsing, weaving, black swans, narrative output, transparency.
\[See document: **Role Of Ai**]

---

### Part IV — Governance & Ethics

The safeguards of legitimacy: licensing, oversight, privacy, reflexivity, humility, ethical vows.
\[See document: **Governance Ethics**]

### Part V — Annexes & Calibration

The scaffolding and accountability: provenance, evaluation, pilot cycles, black swan generator, technical stack, and limits.

**Together these five parts form the Design Codex — the bible of FUTURE_ENGINE.**
*They are not static. Each year, like the Engine itself, they may grow, layer upon layer, recording continuity as faithfully as the timeline they generate.*
