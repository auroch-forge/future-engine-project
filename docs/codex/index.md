# Future Engine Codex  
## Master Index  

*The Codex is the living record of the Future Engine. It is divided into five parts, each self-contained, but together they form the complete design.*

---

### Part I — Core Architecture  
The technical backbone: principles, inputs, data structures, modeling framework, annual cycle, horizons, and limits.  
See: **Part I — Core Architecture**

---

### Part II — Narrative & Public Philosophy  
The civic rationale: why the output is a story, the elder’s voice, one timeline, reflective essays, and narrative style.  
See: **Part II — Narrative & Public Philosophy**

---

### Part III — Role of AI  
The boundaries of artificial intelligence in the Engine: input parsing, weaving, black swans, narrative output, transparency.  
See: **Part III — Role of AI**

---

### Part IV — Governance & Ethics  
The safeguards of legitimacy: licensing, oversight, privacy, reflexivity, humility, ethical vows.  
See: **Part IV — Governance & Ethics**

---

### Part V — Annexes & Calibration  
The scaffolding and accountability: provenance, evaluation, pilot cycles, black swan generator, technical stack, and limits.  
See: **Part V — Annexes & Calibration**

**Together these five parts form the Codex — the bible of the Future Engine.**  
*They are not static. Each year, like the Engine itself, they may grow, layer upon layer, recording continuity as faithfully as the timeline they generate.*
