# Governance Principles

## Future Path

The <span class="notranslate"> Future Engine Project </span> will evolve toward a democratic and decentralized form of governance.

This is not decorative. Given the scale of the project — in both effort and consequence — shared stewardship is essential to its legitimacy.

The precise pathway is still to be defined. Whether through a formal association, distributed councils, or public charters, the structure will be designed with care and transparency.

However, the **Design Codex is not subject to vote or amendment** through governance procedures. It serves as the constitutional basis of the project — a set of founding statutes that define its purpose, boundaries, and methods. While annotations and clarifications may be added, the core text is not mutable by collective decision.

Governance may evolve. Participation may grow. But the Codex remains the foundation on which both rest.
